The program implement a class that represents a fraction number with all funtion needed.
- Support the negative number.
- Input format of fraction: n/d (eg. 2/3 or -1/8).
- Output will be fractional reduced（约分）, and transfer to the integer if it can be(eg. 8/2 -> 4).
- All results with operators will be output directly, then you can input a finite decimal string and change it into fraction.
